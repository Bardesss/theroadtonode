# Monitoring

<Callout emoji="&#x2139;">
        Time: 5 minutes
</Callout>

If you want to know how much resources your Pi is consuming, you can view it with `htop`. By SSHing into your Pi and simply typing `htop`, the monitoring window appears. Htop is installed on your Pi by default, so you don't need to install anything.

What do you see on this screen? At the top are the four cores of the Pi's processor. Below that is the memory usage. You can use `Ctrl + C` or `q` to exit the screen.

Your Pi also gets warm, hence the heatsink. If you want to know how hot the Pi gets, run the following:

```bash
echo "$(cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp)/1000" | bc -l
```
