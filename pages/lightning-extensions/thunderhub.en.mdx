Thunderhub, like Ride The Lightning, is a management tool for your node. Visit [the website](https://www.thunderhub.io/) to discover all the features.

### Requirements

* [NodeJS](/raspberry-pi/common-dependencies#nodejs)

## Source code

Download the source code from Thunderhub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apotdevin/thunderhub
```

Go to the code.

```bash
cd thunderhub
```

Get the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git checkout v0.13.13
```

Get all the necessary software dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create the file `.env.local`:

```bash
nano .env.local
```

Paste the following into it:

```toml
ACCOUNT_CONFIG_PATH='/home/ubuntu/.thunderhub/config.yaml'
PORT=4000
```

Save it with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`. This is a minimal setup in terms of configuration. More parameters that you can use are in the `.env` file.

Now we go back to your home directory and create a folder called .thunderhub. In this folder, we will create a config file for Thunderhub.

```bash
mkdir ~/.thunderhub && nano ~/.thunderhub/config.yaml
```

Paste this in:

```yaml
masterPassword: 'PASSWORD_HERE'
accounts:
  - name: 'ANY_NAME_HERE'
    serverUrl: '127.0.0.1:10009'
    lndDir: '/home/ubuntu/.lnd'
```

The `masterPassword` you can modify as you wish and you will need it to log into Thunderhub in your browser later. After you start Thunderhub for the first time, this password will be rewritten with a hashed value. Save it with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

## Installation

We'll go back to the directory containing the Thunderhub software if you weren't already there:

```bash
cd ~/thunderhub
```

To install Thunderhub:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Firewall

Open port 4000.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 4000 comment "Port for Thunderhub"
```

Should you wish to use Thunderhub from outside your network, you must throw open port 4000 on your router and forward traffic to your Pi.

## Automation

How do you make Thunderhub start up automatically? For that, we create a Thunderhub service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/thunderhub.service
```

Paste this into it.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Thunderhub
Requires=lnd.service
After=lnd.service

[Service]
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/thunderhub
ExecStart=npm start
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save it again with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`. The application is started on port 4000. By default this is port 3000, but this port is also used for the [Ride The Lightning](/lightning-extensions/ride-the-lightning) application.

The system must be notified of the new service and can then be started.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable thunderhub
```

```bash
sudo systemctl start thunderhub
```

If you want to see if everything started up properly, run this:

```bash
systemctl status thunderhub
```

If you want an overview of the status over multiple session, use this:

```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u thunderhub
```

## Using

Go to `http://[the ip address of your Pi]:4000` in your browser to open Thunderhub.  
Use the password `password` to log in unless you entered a different password in the `config.yaml` file.

## Updating

<Callout type="warning" emoji="&#x26A0;">
	When upgrading a Thuderhub from before v0.13.0 to v0.13.0+, changes to the `.env.local` file are required. Please take a look at the [section "configuration"](#configuration).
</Callout>

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/thunderhub
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> # For example, v0.13.13
```

Install the software.

```bash
npm install

npm run build
```

Restart the Thunderhub service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart thunderhub
```

Thunderhub is now updated!
