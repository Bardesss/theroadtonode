# Lightning Terminal

Lightning Terminal gives the user a nice skin around existing tools from Lightning Labs. The tools are [Loop](https://lightning.engineering/loop), [Faraday](https://github.com/lightninglabs/faraday) and [Pool](https://lightning.engineering/pool). At the moment, Loop is good to use through LiT. Pool also works fine, but is still in preview phase. Faraday has only 1 functionality in LiT, but more will be added.

### LiT use cases as far as.

* A visual overview of the balance of your Lightning channels.
* Balancing channels via Loop using submarine swaps.
* Balancing is done with on-chain satoshis with Loop In.
* You pay less fees when you balance multiple channels at once.
* Easily send satoshis to your on-chain wallet with Loop Out.
* Participate in the Lightning Network liquidity market with Pool.
* Downloadable overview of channels in CSV format with Faraday.

A demo video can be found [here](https://lightning.engineering/static/terminal-2c00f93b062f44e5c2d1db067f7ee8cd.mp4).

## Configuring LND for LiT

If you have installed LND without any special installation tags, you need to reinstall LND for a while. If you followed the guide, you don't have to worry and you can skip this section.

Since we are reinstalling LND with new tags, the macaroon files (files that provide authentication) need to be removed. After restarting the fresh installation, the files will be recreated.

<Callout emoji="&#x2139;">
	Your channels and wallet will continue to exist on a reinstallation of LND. Just like an update.

Are you running Thunderhub or other tools that depend on LND? If so, you'll need to restart those after restarting LND as well.
</Callout>

Go to the source files directory of LND to reinstall LND with the correct installation tags.

```bash
cd ~/lnd
```

Install LND with the appropriate tags.

```bash
make install tags="autopilotrpc signrpc walletrpc chainrpc invoicesrpc routerrpc watchtowerrpc monitoring"
```

Check for macaroon files.

```bash
ls -la ~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet
```

The macaroon files you need to delete are: `admin.macaroon`, `invoice.macaroon`, `readonly.macaroon` `router.macaroon` .

Delete the macaroon files.

```bash
rm -i ~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/*.macaroon
```

Answer the questions with `yes` to delete each file.

Restart LND. This will also create new macaroons.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lnd
```

Unlock your wallet with your password.

```bash
lncli unlock
```

## Installation

Navigate back to your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
```

Download the source code for Lightning Terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-terminal
```

Dive into the code.

```bash
cd lightning-terminal
```

Grab the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git checkout v0.7.0-alpha
```

Install Lightning Terminal. This may take about 15 minutes.

```bash
make install
```

## Configuration

Configuring LiT - like many other things in this guide - is done via a configuration file. The file contains all the settings and during the startup of LiT the settings will be applied.

Create the `.lit` folder in your home directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/.lit
```

Create the configuration file.

```bash
nano ~/.lit/lit.conf
```

Copy the following into the configuration file.

```toml
# Lightning Terminal application settings
uipassword=THINK_OF_A_PASSWORD
network=mainnet
httpslisten=0.0.0.0:8443

# Remote LND settings
remote.lnd.rpcserver=127.0.0.1:10009
remote.lnd.macaroonpath=/home/ubuntu/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon
remote.lnd.tlscertpath=/home/ubuntu/.lnd/tls.cert

# Remote Faraday settings
faraday-mode=remote
remote.faraday.rpcserver=127.0.0.1:8465
remote.faraday.macaroonpath=/home/ubuntu/.faraday/mainnet/faraday.macaroon
remote.faraday.tlscertpath=/home/ubuntu/.faraday/mainnet/tls.cert

# Remote Loop settings
loop-mode=remote
remote.loop.rpcserver=127.0.0.1:11010
remote.loop.macaroonpath=/home/ubuntu/.loop/mainnet/loop.macaroon
remote.loop.tlscertpath=/home/ubuntu/.loop/mainnet/tls.cert

# Remote Pool settings
pool-mode=remote
remote.pool.rpcserver=127.0.0.1:12010
remote.pool.macaroonpath=/home/ubuntu/.pool/mainnet/pool.macaroon
remote.pool.tlscertpath=/home/ubuntu/.pool/mainnet/tls.cert
```

Above it says `THINK_OF_A_PASSWORD` by the password. Change this to something you like. Save the changes with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

## Firewall

We can access LiT over port 8443, hence we open it.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8443 comment "Port for Lightning Terminal"
```

## Automation

How do you make Lightning Terminal start up automatically? For that, we create another Lightning Terminal service file.

### Create a LiT service

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lit.service
```

Paste this into it.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Lightning Terminal
Requires=bitcoind.service
Requires=lnd.service
Requires=faraday.service
Requires=loop.service
Requires=pool.service
After=bitcoind.service
After=lnd.service
After=faraday.service
After=loop.service
After=pool.service

[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/go/bin/litd
PIDFile=/home/ubuntu/.lit/lit.pid
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the changes with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

Notify the system of the new service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable lit
```

Start the LiT service as follows.

```bash
sudo systemctl start lit
```

If you want to see if the service was started, run this.

```bash
systemctl status lit
```

If you want a view of the status across multiple sessions, use this command.

```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u lit
```

## Using Lightning Terminal

Open `https://IP OF YOUR PI:8443` in the browser to log into Lightning Terminal and get started with the tool. **Don't forget to put HTTPS in front of it.**

### Walkthrough

Getting started with the LiT dashboard? Then follow [this walkthrough](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-terminal/blob/master/doc/WALKTHROUGH.md) from Lightning Labs.

## Updating

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/lightning-terminal
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> #e.g. v0.7.0-alpha
```

Install Lightning Terminal.

```bash
make install
```

Restart the LiT service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lit
```
