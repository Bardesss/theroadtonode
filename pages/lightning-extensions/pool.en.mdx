Pool is 1 of the coolest developments within Lightning. Basically, it enables bonds on the Lightning network. You can earn interest on your bitcoin using Pool, without placing it with a third party. So you always remain in control of your bitcoin.

## Supplies

* [Golang](/raspberry-pi/common-dependencies#golang) **# (update to the latest version before you start)**

## Installation

First, go to your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
```

Download the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightninglabs/pool
```

Enter the directory.

```bash
cd pool
```

Grab the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git checkout v0.6.0-beta
```

Install the Pool software.

```bash
make install
```

Test if it succeeded by temporarily starting Pool.

```bash
poold
```

In the output you will read that pool is connected to your LND and with `Ctrl + C` you can stop `poold` again.

Besides the pool program there is also a CLI installed. You can check it with `pool --version`.

## Firewall

You can access Pool from the outside on two different ports.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8281 comment "Port for REST API of Pool"

sudo ufw allow 12010 comment "Port for RPC from Pool"
```

## Automation

If you want to run Pool in the background then you need another service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pool.service
```

Paste this in.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Pool
Requires=bitcoind.service
Requires=lnd.service
After=bitcoind.service
After=lnd.service

[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/go/bin/poold
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the changes with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

Notify the system of the new service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable pool
```

Start the pool service as follows.

```bash
sudo systemctl start pool
```

If you want to see if the service was started, run this.

```bash
systemctl status pool
```

If you want an overview of the status across multiple sessions, use this command.

```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u pool
```

## Updating

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/pool
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> #e.g. v0.6.0-beta
```

Install the `pooled` software.

```bash
make install
```

Restart the Pool and LiT services (if you have that running).

```bash
sudo systemctl restart pool

sudo systemctl restart lit
```
